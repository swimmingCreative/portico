- Welcome to Portico -
===================
Portico is an open source [HLA Run-Time Infrastructure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-level_architecture)
(RTI) implementation. It is designed to ensure open and free access to the necessary infrastructure
needed to drive HLA federations.

Portico is released under the terms of the
**[Common Distribution and Developer License (CDDL)](https://opensource.org/licenses/CDDL-1.0)**,
which means you can repackage and redistribute it with your applications, and you can modify
the source as long as changes are submitted back to the project.

1. Getting Started
-------------------
  This guide gives you some quick heads-up information to help you get started with
  the Portico open source RTI. Portico supports several of the standard HLA interfaces:
    - HLA v1.3:   Java and C++
    - IEEE-1516:  Java
    - IEEE-1516e: Java and C++

  **For Java**
  Portico ships with a JRE, but you will need a JDK if you are writing federates.
  Portico support a minimum of Java v1.8.0+.

  **For C++**
  Portico provides cross-platform support in 32 and 64-bit. The following libraries are
  pre-packaged depending on the operating system you download for:

    - Windows: VC8, VC9, VC10, 32/64-bit
    - Linux: GCC4, 64-bit
    - Mac OS X: Apple LLVM 6, 7

  When you have installed Portico, you will get a directory structure like so:

  ```
  [RTI_HOME]

    |-- README               (This file)

  ```

2. Running Federates with Portico
----------------------------------
  For the most part, Portico is a drop-in replacement for any other RTI. To use Portico at
  runtime you need to set your environment variables such that the Portico libraries can be
  found on your path.

  Portico also uses the `RTI_HOME` environment variable as is convention for RTIs. If you are
  only use Java federates, this is the only variable you need to set. The others are necessary
  for C++/native federates as listed:

  ```
  *   (all) RTI_HOME          : This should point to the same directory that this file is in
  *  (java) CLASSPATH         : Add RTI_HOME/lib/portico.jar
  * (win32) PATH              : Add %RTI_HOME%\bin\[compiler] and %RTI_HOME%\jre\bin\client
  * (win64) PATH              : Add %RTI_HOME%\bin\[compiler] and %RTI_HOME%\jre\bin\server
  * (mac64) DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH : Add $RTI_HOME/lib/[compiler] and $RTI_HOME/jre/lib/server
  * (lin32) LD_LIBRARY_PATH   : Add $RTI_HOME/lib/[compiler] and $RTI_HOME/jre/lib/client
  * (lin64) LD_LIBRARY_PATH   : Add $RTI_HOME/lib/[compiler] and $RTI_HOME/jre/lib/server
  ```

### The JVM Libraries
  Portico is a Java-based RTI. The C++ interface is a wrapper around the core Java library.
  When you start a C++ federate, the Java Virtual Machine is loaded in the background.
  This is why you must add the second folder to your path as listed above.


3. Writing Federates for Portico
---------------------------------
  Portico ships with some example federates (more below) to both show users how to set up
  their environment correctly, and to provide some sample HLA code to get you started.
  For complete instructions on writing federates, please see the website:

  <http://porticoproject.org/documentation/developer/>


### Writing Java Federates
  All Portico code and all its dependencies are located in a single jar file. Just throw
  `RTI_HOME/lib/portico.jar` on your classpath and you are good to go.

### Writing C++ Federates
  The Portico C++ interfaces are binary drop-in compatible with HLA v1.3 and IEEE-1516e
  federates on Windows, Linux and Mac OS X. If you want to compile and link against Portico,
  you will need the following:

  - Header files: Located in `RTI_HOME/include/[HLA-version]`
  - Library files: Located in `RTI_HOME/lib/[compiler]`

#### Compiling on Windows
  When compiling C++ federates on Windows, you will need to have an appropriate version of
  Visual Studio installed. You can compile through the VS interface, or if you prefer the
  command line, it is simplest to execute inside a Visual Studio Command Prompt.

#### 64-bit Libraries
  Portico provides 64-bit libraries for HLA v1.3 and 1516e. These libraries follow the
  naming convention as defined in the standards:

  - HLA 1.3: `libRTI-NG_64`, `libFedTime_64`
  - IEEE-1516e: `librti1516e64`, `libfedtime1516e64`

#### Debug Libraries
  Portico also ships with debug versions of all libraries. These are suffixed with `d`.
  For example: `librti1516e64d.so`.


4. The Example Federates
-------------------------
  For information on the example federates, see the `README-examples` file.


5. Documentation and Help
-------------------------
  Documentation and open source projects... so how about that ANY OTHER TOPIC.

### Documentation
  Luckily, Portico has been around for some time, so we're building up some devent docs.
  The main website website contains all documentation for the project. This includes
  guides on deploying Portico with common LVC tools, writing federates with Portico,
  how to build Portico for yourself, API references, support information and much more.

  <http://porticoproject.org>

### Bugs and Problems
  If you have found bugs or find that Portico is not working as you would expect, you
  should open an issue via the GitHub project:

  <http://github.com/openlvc/portico>

### Support
  Developer support, provided by living, breathing, full-time job having people is provided.
  This is split into a two tier system: Community Support and Commercial Support.

  `email: support@openlvc.org`

  - **Community Support** is provided on a best-effort basis. We make no guarantees, but we also
  want as many people to using Portico and solving their simulation problems, so we do try.

  - **Commercial Support** is available and you should contact Calytrix Technologies if you wish
  to obtain a quote. Commercial Support comes with response SLAs and can be accessed via the
  same email address, or through the dedicated lines provided in your sign-up information pack.


So there you go, we hope you enjoy using Portico :)
